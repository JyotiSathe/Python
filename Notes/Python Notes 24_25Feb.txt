
real world representation
interaction of multiple objects

real world entity --> object


for python class is also object

4 properties of object

for every object there is identity
every object has state (static and dynamic) values of attribute (i am listening )
behavior methods (changing attributes)
responsibility 



class 
Methods:
	- Manager methods --> creation and destruction of objec
		constructor (initialize) __init__
		destructor (Deinitialize) __del__
	- Accessor/ getter methods --> returns state of object
	- Mutators/ setter methods --> change state of object
Attributes:
	- Object attribute 
	- Class attribute (static attribute in java)
		eg: all person of India country
	
	
	

initial state <-- constructor 
No overloading in python so we cannot have multiple contructors, so there is no case to have same name to constructor as class
